# Todo List

Built with HTML, CSS and JS. This todo list website allows you to create different projects, each with their own todo lists.
Each item has a status (done or not done, demonstrated by line through text and background color) and a due date.
You can add and delete projects and items and your changes will be saved in local storage.
